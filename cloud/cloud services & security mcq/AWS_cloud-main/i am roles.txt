IAM Roles:(interaction b/w two services)
~~~~~~~~~
*we apply policy to the services.
(S3<-->lambda intermediate we create roles within give them a policy.)

NOTE:AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events 
and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. 
These events may include changes in state or an update, such as a user placing an item in a 
shopping cart on an ecommerce website.

*Roles: services-->lambda-->execution(AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole)--> next-->role details--> create.

*S3 bucket:---------

*Lambda function-->create fun-->change role

*add triger--> selecte source(S3)-->bucket select.

then, upload a file in bucket

*monitor-->view in logs cloud watch.

*Ntification:
*add destionation(service--.SNS)
Then
SNS(simple notification service)--> name--> standerd create topic
subscription-->create sub-->protocol-->Email
then go to lambda
add dest-->add SNS(Asyncr,On success,Dest type)

Note:In linux read [Cronjob].


Q1:Create a two s3 buckect as "prn-lab" and "name_lab".then create two lambda functions and attach roles
to function for s3 bucket.Then add triggers for ".pdf" on "prn-lab" bucket and ".jpg" on "name_lab" s3 bucket.
Create a SNS service and attach to destination of both functions and show the logs for "prn_lab" bucket and
"name-lab" bucket.

Q2:Create one IAM user , create full eccess policy for S3,lmbda ,SNS and read/write policy for IAM then create
two buckets then create one lambda function and attach role for S3 bucket then triggers for .txt file on fisrt bucket
and .png file on second bucket create SNS service and show logs for both buckets.
